# sidewalkwidths
During 2020, COVID-19 made urban dwellers hyper aware of how the width of sidewalks impacted their ability to maintain social distance. This prompted both amateur and experienced cartographers from around the world to map the sidewalk widths in their cities. This website compiles the maps from those grassroots efforts.
