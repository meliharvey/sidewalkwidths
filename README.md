# sidewalkwidths
In a response to COVID-19, a grassroots effort of cartographers from around the world made maps of the sidewalk widths in their cities. This repo houses a simple website that is a list of these maps so that they are accessed from a single place.

Each map was created independently and without any overarching coordination across cities. However, they share portions of the source code from: www.github.com/meliharvey/sidewalkwidths-nyc
